# PiCycle S.E.A.T.
The PiCycle S.E.A.T. (Situational and Environmental Awareness Technology) aims to combine ultrasonic sensors with a Raspberry Pi utilising haptic feedback with the objective of increasing road safety for cyclists.

HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors placed under the seat of the bicycle facing backwards will detect the approach of foreign objects and alert the cyclist via small vibration motors situated within the rider's helmet.

The system will increase road safety for bicycle users by allowing them to 'feel' what they cannot see behind them. Current solutions rely on wearable mirrors as wrist bands. These force cyclists to take their eyes off the road infront creating more potential dangers. The PiCycle S.E.A.T enables continuous blind spot observation without distracting the cyclist.
